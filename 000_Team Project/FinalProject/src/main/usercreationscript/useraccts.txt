
User Creation Script. To configure basic authentication where each user can only view their webpage and group's a and b can view all webpages.

Create the users and groups on the Glassfish Server First:

	Start the server
	Right click on View Domain Admin Console
	Expand server-config
	Expand security
	Expand Realms
	Select file
	Manage users
	Add user name, group, password
	Click save
	Repeat for each user below.
	The user id, group, and password are all the same. For groupa and groupb, list the names of each group (everyone's names) separated by a colon(:)

	kenneth
	mark
	anthony
	kevin
	jose
	chandler
	groupa
	groupb

After all users are created and saved, proceed below.

	Expand Configurations
	Expand server-config
	Select security
	Select checkbox for Default Principal to Role Mapping Enabled
	Save
	Close out console

Create a folder for each user in the webpages(in the webapp folder if you do in file explorer) directory, use the same naming convention, their first name and put each user's xhtml file in their respective folders. 
You don't have to do this for group a or b.

Update the web.xml file with security constraints from my file or just replace it with what I sent. If you replace it, make sure the url-pattern and welcome-file values are updated for how you set up your webapp instance.

Add the file folder path to the template xhtml file to each outcome value in the h:link elements. (example: "/norman/ctbsexample")

Click on a user's link, you will be prompted for the creds configured in Glassfish. 
	You have to close the browser completely each time to test it, whatever creds you used will be cached by the browser.
